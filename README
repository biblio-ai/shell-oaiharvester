The OAI-PMH Shell Harvester is able to harvest OAI-PMH targets. It supports multiple configurable targets which can be updated individually. Optionally, by providing the extra ListIdentifiers option, only the idenfiers will be retrieved.

Installing shell-harvester:
 - git clone git://github.com/wimmuskee/shell-oaiharvester.git
 - dependencies: xsltproc, bc

Using shell-harvester:

1. Configure the harvester
   Edit the paths in the config.xml file, 
   records are stored in <recordpath>/<repository_id>/harvested .

2. Configure a repository
   Edit a repository in the config.xml file,
   set, conditional and recordpath are not required.

3. Run the harvester
   $ ./oaiharvester -r <repository_id>

4. Only retrieve identifiers (doesn't work)
   $ ./oaiharvester -r <repository_id> -n
